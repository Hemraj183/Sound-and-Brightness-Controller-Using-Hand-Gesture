### Project Name:- Virtual mouse using hand tracking

### Aim:- The aim is to control cursor movement and actions virtually using hand tracking and gestures

#### Project summary:- 
The project is about controlling the cursor movement and actions using hand tracking and finger gestures. The cursor's position will be only controlled if the hand is detected inside the boundary screen. We will use openCV and Mediapipe for hand detection and tracking, Numpy to perform calculations related to cursor location, Wx-Python to capture screen size and Pynput to integrate finger movement with cursor.
