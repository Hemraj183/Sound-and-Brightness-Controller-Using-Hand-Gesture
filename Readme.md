### Sound and Brightness Controller Using Hand Gesture

This project helps us to control the sound and brightness of our local machine using hand gesture. I used medipipe and opencv libarary for making the hand gesture and pycaw libarary for controlling the sound of machine and last screen brightness control libarary for controlling the brightness of the machine.
The thumb and index finger is used for controlling the sound of the system.
The thumn and middle finger is used frr controlling the birightness of the system.

#### Note: The sreen brightness control libarary works little slow, so it might takes some times to see the changes in brightness, but for sound its works best.
You change the hand that it capture, for best result the number of hand should be put as 1 and you can changes the camera capture as 0 for main camera and 1,2.. for respective external camera.

#### You can also changes the finger index as your requirements or add fingers functions too. The image of of mediapipe finger index is also given you can watch that too.
